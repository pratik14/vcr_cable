# VcrCable

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/spaghetticode/vcr_cable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/spaghetticode/vcr_cable)

This gem allows you to use VCR in development. This is quite handy when your app
interacts frequently with external services and you're on a sloppy connection,
or when you want to save bandwidth, or when you happen to have no connection
at all.


## Usage

Add the required gem(s) to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vcr_cable'
gem 'fakeweb' # or webmock
```

*Note: You can choose between the FakeWeb and WebMock gems for faking web requests. If one of those gems is already loaded by your application it will be used automatically.*

By default `vcr_cable` is disabled. In order to enable it you need to start the server with the ENV variable `ENABLE_VCR_CABLE=true` like this:

```bash
ENABLE_VCR_CABLE=true bundle exec rails s
```

Or you can enable `vcr_cable` in the yaml config file (check the section below).

That's it! Now all external requests will hit the remote servers only one time, and the application will subsequently use the recorded data.

## Custom VCR Configuration

The default VCR configuration is:

```yaml
development:
  hook_into: fakeweb
  cassette_library_dir: development_cassettes
  enable_erb: false
  match_requests_on: [uri]
  allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette: true
  enable_vcr_cable: false
```

If you want to override those values or configure `vcr_cable` to work in some
other environment you can generate the `vcr_cable.yml` config file and update it:

```bash
bundle exec rails generate vcr_cable
```

The file will be located in the ```config``` folder of your rails application.

## Config via env

You can also enable/disable vcr_cable by setting `ENABLE_VCR_CABLE=true` or `ENABLE_VCR_CABLE=false` in your environment. This allows each developer to opt in or opt out for vcr_cable on their own machine.

## Extra

If you use `vcr_cable` in development I recommend to enable http requests for webmock or fakeweb. Just create an initializer, for example:

```ruby
WebMock.allow_net_connect! if defined? WebMock
```

It will prevent exceptions when you disable `vcr_cable`.
